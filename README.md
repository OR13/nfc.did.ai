# nfc.did.ai

This repo contains nfc experiments, and some custom tooling for working with tangem nfc cards.

None of this is endorsed by tangem / nxp and any code is unoffocial / alpha level stuff... for reference only.

DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.

Some demos store seed values in querystrings, which is fundamentally not safe, and is used only for web-nfc demonstration purposes.

For example: [https://nfc.did.ai/nxp?seed=7052adea8f9823817065456ecad5bf24dcd31a698f7bc9a0b5fc170849af4226](https://nfc.did.ai/nxp?seed=7052adea8f9823817065456ecad5bf24dcd31a698f7bc9a0b5fc170849af4226)

DO NOT DO THIS IN PRODUCTION.
